# Yiddish vocab

Currently, this just contains a single txt file, which contains words to study
for Yiddish. These are formatted so Anki can import them: three fields,
separated by a semicolon, corresponding to the Yiddish word, the English
translation, and the YIVO-standard transliteration.

I'm also using AnkiWeb to sync the cards, but this serves as an extra source, in
case I need them.
